# eql? checks both the value type and the actual value it holds.
5.eql?(5.0) #=> false; although they are the same value, one is an integer and the other is a float
5.eql?(5)   #=> true

# equal? checks whether both values are the exact same object in memory. 
# This can be slightly confusing because of the way computers store some values for efficiency. 
# Two variables pointing to the same number will usually return true.
a = 5
b = 5
a.equal?(b) #=> true
# This expression is true because of the way computers store integers in memory. 
# Although two different variables are holding the number 5, they point to the same object in memory. However, consider the next code example:

a = "hello"
b = "hello"
a.equal?(b) #=> false
# This happens because computers canâ€™t store strings in the same efficient way they store numbers. 
# Although the values of the variables are the same, the computer has created two separate string objects in memory.

# spaceship operator
# <=> (spaceship operator) returns the following:
